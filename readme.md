# Orca Controller Client

This repository contains autogenerated golang client code for communicating with Orca over dbus. In order to use this library to communicate with Orca or regenerate bindings, you must use a recent version of Orca. This library may change as Orca dbus bindings are not yet stable until the release of Orca v49.0

For examples of using this client library see the [test file](./lib_test.go)

## Installing

Run the following command to install the library in your go project

```
go get github.com/c-loftus/orca-controller
```
